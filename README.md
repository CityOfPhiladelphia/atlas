_Note: this is a mockup/proof of concept only._

Explore addresses in the City of Philadelphia. Find information about property ownership, zoning/land use, city services, and nearby facilities such as parks, schools, and polling places. An interactive map allows you to navigate the city to learn more about the locations that interest you. This is intended as a unified point of access for City websites such as the Property Search, Parcel Explorer, Zoning Archive, and other location-based apps.
