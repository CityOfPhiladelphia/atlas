Atlas
Philadelphia in 360&deg - data, street and sky
-----
_Note: this is currently a demostration application only._

The genisis of Atlas was to replace the internal city application Address Explorer and to also act as a demonstration for the Address Information System (AIS) api.

The scope of the application has grown to include prototyping replacements for applications such as Parcel Explorer, Zoning Archive, and the Zoning map in phila.gov/map

Addtitionaly, the application ties together the Cyclomedia Street Smart viewer and the Pictometry viewer to match the address placement on the map.
