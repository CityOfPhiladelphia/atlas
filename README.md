# Atlas

## Philadelphia in 360 Degrees: Data, Street and Sky

_Note: This is currently a demonstration application only._

The genesis of Atlas was to replace the internal City application Address Explorer and to also act as a demonstration for the Address Information System (AIS) API.

The scope of the application has grown to include prototyping replacements for applications such as Parcel Explorer, Zoning Archive, and the zoning map in phila.gov/map.

Additionally, the application ties together Cyclomedia and Pictometry imagery viewers which sync automatically when interacting with the map.
